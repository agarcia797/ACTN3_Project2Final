# ACTN3_Project2Final
This is my final draft of my BIMM 143 Project 2 in Python. 

Scientific Question: Is the ACTN3 gene sequences significantly different from the ACTN2 gene and is one more correlated with increased athletic performance?

Scientific Hypothesis: If the ACTN3 gene is correlated with increased endurance and sprint athletic performance, then the ACTN3 gene will be significantly different from ACTN2 gene which is expressed in non-athletes. 

You will need a few files in order to adequately run the code:

1) The jupyter notebook
2) The datasets for ACTN3 and ACTN2 (both uploaded here) 
3) Three csv files created from data in “ACTN3 Genotype Is Associated with Human Elite Athletic Performance” by Nan Yang (https://doi.org/10.1086/377590) for bioinformatics statistical analysis ('ACTN3table.csv') and plot visualization ('ACTN3plot.csv') & ('ACTN3plotx.csv'). 

Information on where FASTA files were found: 

The ACTN3 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/89) and ACTN2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/88) gene sequences were found in the NCBI database.
